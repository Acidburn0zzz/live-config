Customization
=============


1. Adding new config scripts

Downstream projects can put their scripts into /lib/live/config and don't need
to do anything else, the scripts will be called automatically during boot. An
example script can be found in /usr/share/doc/live-config/examples/scripts.

Such scripts are best put into an own debian package. A sample debian directory
can be found in /usr/share/doc/live-config/exmaples/debian.
