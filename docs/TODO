TODO

1. Status

live-config works quite well already, however, it's software in development and
we continue to release pre-releases until:

  * documentation is more complete.
  * boot parameters don't change anymore and we agreed on a common layout of
    everything.

2. Regressions

Everything that worked with live-initramfs works with live-boot/live-config,
except for the following things:

  * temporarily no serial console support during booting. this will be added
    back in some time.
  * the locale script temporarily doesn't automatically configures the keyboard
    when a 'short' locale is specified (like locales=de).
  * not exactely a regression, but some boot parameters did change, have a look
    at the manpage of live-config.

3. Todo items

  * allow some scripts (most prominently locales) to be run even in persistent mode.
  * use build-time distribution detection, remove dead code from build.
  * use verbose/quiet/debug/interactive modes for scripts.
  * use logfile.
  * enable display managers only if they are the selected one.
  * add option to specify the xsession.
  * when not using persistency, do not import options into the debconf db.
  * cleanup the scripts order and splitting.
