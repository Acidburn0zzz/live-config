TODO
====


1. Status

live-config works quite well already, however, it's software in development and
we continue to release pre-releases until:

  * documentation is more complete.
  * boot parameters don't change anymore and we agreed on a common layout of
    everything.


2. Todo items

  * use build-time distribution detection, remove dead code from build.
  * use verbose/quiet/debug/interactive modes for scripts.
  * use logfile.
  * write documentation:
    - explain customization.
    - explain precomupted configuration (requires dropping boot parameter and
      having config.conf).
  * add upstart integration.
  * enable display managers only if they are the selected one.
